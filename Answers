1. What did you think of the provided acceptance criteria?

2. If this were a real story from a real life Product Owner - what questions would you ask?

- What is the minimum length of the search term required?
- How many search results should be displayed in a page? Given that it returns hundreds of search result.
Pagination is always a good choice for displaying search result.
- What is the request timeout while fetching the search result? what should be the message displayed if the given timeout is exceeded?
- How should the search results be ordered? Is it be the most popular product or by most relevant? D we want to give user an option to choose?


3. Why did you choose to structure your code in the way you did?

4. If you had more time what improvements would you make to your code?

5. What is your usual approach to testing on a project?
- Setup the framework (if it has not been set yet)
- After reading the acceptance criteria I write down feature file according to it. This gives me an idea of how it fits into the current flow.
- Write down test cases.
- Ensure api tests cover the search functionality
- UI tests should cover the if the search icon is displayed and search input field and the results displayed int he table format
